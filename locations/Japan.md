List of amazing things to eat, do and experience in Japan :japan:

Just wanted to have a list of suggestions not only for future visits but also to share with friends who decide to make a trip to Nihon.

Inspired by my Summer 2015 trip with Hayg. There was only so much we could do in nine days so the list isn't very comprehensive, but I promise it will grow.

## Tokyo

### Experience

#### [Tsukiji market](http://www.tsukiji-market.or.jp/tukiji_e.htm) :fish:

Amazing huge fish market. Very touristic at this point but still worth going.  It opens at 9am, go as early as nine to see everything.]

* Delicious sushi nearby for breakfast :)
  * Sushi Dai*
* 5am Tuna auction
  * If you wake up early enough and get lucky, it's doable.

#### Imperial Palace Park

Start at Kudanshita station and make your way down. The whole park is worth exploring.

* Nippon Budokan
 * We stumbled in for Saturday morning tournaments. Really cool.
* National Museum of Modern Art
 * Amazing art, part of which is  Japanese.
* Imperial Palace

### Food

#### Sushi :sushi:
* [UOBEI](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d3871559-Reviews-Uobei_Shibuya_Dogenzaka-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html)
 * Touch screen ¥100 sushi that zips to you on rails
* [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/honkan.html)
 * A **must**
 * Best sushi I've had in my life. Worth the wait.
 * Umegaoka location preferable


#### Ramen :ramen:

## Kyoto

### Experience

#### [Staying overnight at Ninna-ji temple](https://ninnaji.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/staying-overnight-at-ninna-ji/)

Definitely a must.

A UNESCO world heritage site. By staying overnight at the temple you will have the special opportunity to attend the morning service with the monks in Kon-do. You will also be given free pass to enter Goten, the palace area where you can explore.

Life-changing experience. There is a strip in Ninna-ji temple that you walk after the Kon-do and when you walk that strip after you pray, you are thought to be reborn.

Authentic japanese breakfast included.

#### Rent a bike :bike:

Kyoto is a very bike friendly city and biking from temple to temple through alleyways and hidden neighborhoods is the best way to explore the city.

* Bike down the Kamo river to Fushimi-inari and back up the stream near it.
* ¥1000 for the whole day

### Food

* [はなまる串カツ製作所](http://tabelog.com/en/kyoto/A2601/A260101/26018242/?rvwid=6186436) :sake:
 * Izakaya - cozy authentic place with delicious deep fried finger food and drinks. Go at night, wait out the line.

* [Kyogaku Kaneyo](http://kyotofoodie.com/kaneyo-kyoto-unagi-eel-restaurant/)
 * A long-loved eel restaurant from the taisho era. They've been in business for around 100 years. This place is a **must**. (a bit pricey)

* [Kagizen Yoshifusa](http://www.yelp.com/biz/%E9%8D%B5%E5%96%84%E8%89%AF%E6%88%BF-%E6%9C%AC%E5%BA%97-%E4%BA%AC%E9%83%BD%E5%B8%82)*
 * Kyoto is all about Japanese confectionaries. Kagizen Yoshifusa is most famous for its kuzukiri noodles. This is the only place the imperial palace orders kuzukiri noodles from. Definitely come here when you are walking around Gion!

### Temples & Shrines

* [Kiyomizu-dera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizu-dera)
 * A **must**
 * A lot of different religious artifacts to see
 * Overlooks Kyoto

* [Fushimi-inari shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha)
 * A **must**
 * Tori tunnels, beautiful
 * Fox statues

* [Daigo-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo-ji)*
 *  It is a mountain with temples scattered all over it. Monks come here to train and you can see the houses they live in. It is technically a hike, but a beautiful one.

* [Chūgū-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABg%C5%AB-ji)*
 * Miroku Bosatsu statue

* [Saiho-ji](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3937.html)*
 * Amazing moss garden. Need to apply for visitor passes, long process but pays off.

* [Ryoan-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dan-ji)*
 * One of the first, if not the first, Zen temple. It is a large complex with a cool rock garden etc.

### Nara

Good day trip from Kyoto.

* Deer
 * Everywhere
 * Photograph, pet, feed, get bitten.

* [Todai-ji Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji)
 * Astonishing - houses the world's largest bronze statue of the Buddha
 * Try to pass through buddha's nostril - get blessed.

### Osaka

Good day trip from Kyoto.

## Misc

### Tips

If you plan on leaving Tokyo, definitely get a [Japan Rail Pass](http://www.jrpass.com/?gclid=CIPXvNjB4ccCFcKWvQodi2ALnQ).
It's $220 but it will save you a lot of money. Make sure to use it in Tokyo as well - you can take JR lines for free.

### Experience

#### Take local train into countryside of Japan

We decided to take a local train north from Nagoya and got off at the last stop of a track in a little town in the mountains called Tarumi.

Luckily a local helped us find a hotel with an onsen.
Most authentic and beautiful experience. We we're the only foreigners there.
